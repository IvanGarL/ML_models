<em>**A first approach to different Machine learning models using Sklearn Python library**</em>

## 1. KNN vs Linear Reg vs Polynomial Reg:
The first approach to prediction tasks, this first Jupyter Notebook compares the performance of three basic models: K Nearest Neighbours with Linear and Polynomial regression models. The objective was to compare two important measures of the model evaluation process: the MSE and the R^2 score (coefficient of determination), making a custom variation of the hyperparameters of each model.
